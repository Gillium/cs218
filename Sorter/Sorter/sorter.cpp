//1. Design and implement a variation of QuickSorter class that partitions the sequence to be sorted using the pivot other than the first element in the sequence.
//Run a sequence of experiments to compare the running times of your sorter with your new pivot selection.



//2. Design and implement Radix sorter of an array by using and Queue ADT for each group.
//You may use Queue Template class that you implemented in CS217.
//Run a sequence of experiments to compare the running times.



//3. Design and implement Merge sorter of an array by using recursion.
//Run a sequence of experiments to compare the running times.



//4. Your sample outputs should include test run using the following data:
//a. a set of 1000 or more numbers (either randomly generated, or any actual data)
//b. a set of 5000 or more words (either randomly generated, or e-book, etc)
//c. anything that you like to try to sort



//5. Performance analysis
//a. How many comparisons made in each sorter for the same test data (you need to use the same data to each sorter for comparison)
//b. How long each sorter ran for the same set of test data
//c. Does it change for different size or different data type
